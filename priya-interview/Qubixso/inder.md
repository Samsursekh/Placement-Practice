# what is css module?
CSS Modules allows us to use the same class name in multiple files without clashes since each class name is given a unique programmatic name. This is especially useful in larger applications. Every class name is scoped locally to the specific component in which it is being imported.
In CSS Modules, you can send classes to multiple components. One of the key benefits of using CSS Modules is that you may edit any CSS file with assurance and without concern for how it would affect other sites. Create portable and reusable CSS files with CSS Modules.
