6] ) State the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM

# Real Dom
 
 It is a structural representation of HTML elements of a web application


- It can directly update HTML
- Creates a new DOM if the element updates.




# Virtual Dom

React uses Virtual DOM, which can be thought of as a blueprint of the DOM. 

- It can't update HTML directly
- Update the JSX if the element update

# This Virtual DOM works in three simple steps-
 i. Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire Ul is
    re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation
 ii. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation 
      and the new one is calculated
 iii. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only 
       the things that have actually changed
