# tic- tac-app  
Create a new React app: Use npx create-react-app my-app command in your terminal to create a new React project.

Set up the initial components: Create a new file called TicTacToe.js in your src directory. Inside this file, create a functional component that renders the basic game board.

Create state: In order to keep track of the current state of the game, create a state variable called board using the useState hook. This variable will hold an array of 9 elements, representing the squares on the board.

Implement click handlers: Use the onClick attribute to add click handlers to each of the board squares. Inside the click handler, update the board state with the current player's symbol (either "X" or "O").

Check for a winner: After each move, check the board state to see if there is a winner. If there is a winner, display a message and prevent any further moves from being made.

Add reset functionality: Add a button that allows the user to reset the game at any time.

Style the game: Use CSS to style the game board, squares, and any other elements as desired.

With these basic steps, you should be able to create a functional tic-tac-toe app in React.js. Keep in mind that there are many additional features you can add to make the game more interesting or challenging, such as a computer opponent or different board sizes. Good luck with your project!
