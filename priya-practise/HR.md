# 6]  Which project that you did at Masai School did you find the most challenging and why? Tell me about the project which you made.

The project I made in unit 5 was an E-commerce skill-up website. The skill-up project basically sells the courses on demand online teaching like udemy.

Objective⇒ the skill-up mission is to provide flexible, effective skill development education. Providing a skill-up platform with many courses in many fields like Learn programming, marketing, data science, and more.

Skill-up is a unique project because skill-up is not a clone of any website. Rather than just taking a theme of this udemy website. 

This project was a collaborative project. In my project team, there were  4 members. My project was completed within a week with support from my team members. We have completed 90% functionality of the website and due to the time limit we could not do the remaining functionality but in the future, we will do so.


In this project, my task was to create a user signup page, and a user login page with authentication, and helped my one of teammates create add cart functionality. This was my overall contribution to the team project.

When I was working on a project I used functionalities like React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redux-Thunk, CRUD operation, Firebase, Render
I used an external CSS library, like a bootstrap, react-component
 
When I was doing the project I learned a lot. I learned how to develop,  write logic and implement coding. I have better in coding after joining Masai Coding School.


In the project work, the most challenging part was user direct login with our google account but with my friends' support, I was able to do it. I watched videos online on youtube and talked with my friends to overcome the challenges.
