# what are the collections in mongodb?

- A collection in MongoDB is a group of documents.

- Collections in a NoSQL database like MongoDB correspond to tables in relational database management systems (RDBMS) or SQL databases.

- In general, we recommend limiting collections to 10,000 per replica set. When users begin exceeding 10,000 collections, they typically see decreases in performance.

#  what are javascript considered as single threaded language

- JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it has only one call stack that is used to execute the program.
- The call stack is the same as the stack data structure. Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO (first in last out).

# Why node JS is a single threaded language?

- A Node. js application runs on single thread and the event loop also runs on the same thread. Hence, we can say Node. js is single-threaded but the catch is that there are some libraries in Node.

- It follows Single Threaded with Event Loop Model. Node JS Processing model mainly based on Javascript Event based model with Javascript callback mechanism.

# what is middleware? explain with an example
- Middleware is software and cloud services that provide common services and capabilities to applications and help developers and operators build and deploy applications more efficiently.

- ex: a web server is middleware that connects websites to the backend database. 
- When you submit a form on a website, your computer sends the request in XML or JSON to the web server.

- API management are all commonly handled by middleware.
